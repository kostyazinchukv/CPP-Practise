# Task
- Implemet a very specific hash table
- Use only one **cpp** file with no headers
- Keys are lower-case English words
- Length of a key is at most 10 character
- Hash function - take last character of a key
- Hash table contains exactly 26 slots(a-z)
- Slots have three different state: "never used", "occupied", "tombstone"
- Table start with never used
- Searching works as follows:
    - Given a key, take its last character as the hash value
    - First try the corresponidng table slot
    - If the key is there, you've found it, if it's "never user" - it doesn't exist
    - Keep trying until you find it or untill you certain that it doesn't exist.
- Insertion works as follow:
    - First perform search to see if keys exists - if it does, do nothing.
    - Take the last character of key as hash value
    - If that slot is not "occupied", pyt the key there
    - if it's "occupied" try the next slot until you find a free slot
- Deletion works as follows:
    - Given a key, search for it to locate it's slot(if it doesn't exist do nothing)
    - if found, change state to "tombstone"
- Command line input is "modification moves" separated by spaces:
    - **AKey** - add key to table(Aapple means insert apple)
    - **DKey** - delete key from table(Dapple means delete apple)
- Once input is processed, output all slots.
- Ignore invalid inputs
- Compile with:
> g++ -o main.out -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall {you-name-it}.cpp
